# Testing Transport API

## Prerequisites:

You'll need to create an account to access TransportAPI, which is the API used in test2.py. Head over to https://developer.transportapi.com/ and create an account if you don't have one.

File test.py is using TFL's API, which can be used for free (with limited requests per minute), so nothing needs to be done to run it (apart from the installation steps below).

## Installation:

1- Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2- Activate your virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3- Install what's on requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a *config.py* file to save your app ID and Key for TransportAPI.

Now you are done and can run *test.py* and *test2.py* in your Terminal.

This is a good start to start playing around both APIs, have fun!
